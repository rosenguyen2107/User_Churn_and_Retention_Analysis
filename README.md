# User Churn & Retention Analysis in E-commerce
*A Product Analytics & Predictive Modeling Case Study*

## Project Overview
This project analyzes user behavior and churn dynamics in a large-scale e-commerce platform using event-level data.
The objective is to answer three core product questions:
1. Where do users drop off in the activation funnel?
2. Which behavioral signals causally drive churn?
3. Which product levers can most effectively improve retention?
   
The project combines:
- Funnel and cohort analysis (descriptive)
- Churn prediction (logistic regression)
- Causal interpretation (Partial Dependence)
- Behavioral segmentation (value & engagement)
- Prescriptive business recommendations
- This structure mirrors how Product Analytics and Data Science teams support growth and retention decisions in real-world companies.
